Hi! My name is Igor Belov and I am iOS Developer.

Now I live in Innopolis, Russia, and study at the University there.

I mostly write in Swift and SwiftUI, but also have some experience with Objective-C. I have used many different frameworks over the time, listing which makes little practical sense, therefore I will leave some major ones: Alamofire/Moya, CoreData, AVFoundation, Photos, Combine, RxSwift...
